A well-cut diamond reflects light beautifully, influencing its price. Shapes like round offer unique brilliance, impacting attractiveness and cost.

The cleaner a diamond, the higher the price. Grading reports from institutions like GIA or IGI often detail these aspects.

*Color* measures how colorless a diamond is.

Diamonds closer to being colorless are pricier. The scale ranges from D (colorless) to Z (light color), with colorless stones fetching higher prices.

| Factor           | Description                                         | Impact on Price                            |

| **Carat Weight** | Measures the size of the diamond.                   | Higher weight, higher price.               |
| **Cut**          | Quality of light reflection based on shape and cut. | Better cut, more sparkle, higher price.    |
| **Clarity**      | Number of internal and external flaws.              | Fewer flaws, higher clarity, higher price. |
| **Color**        | Absence of color in the diamond.                    | More colorless, higher price.              |

Many people prefer a full carat for symbolic reasons, which affects demand and price.

A 0.98 carat stone, while almost visually identical to a 1 carat when set in jewelry, can be less expensive.

This is because it just falls under the 1 carat mark that often leads to noticeable price jumps.

**Comparison Table**

| Carat Weight | Appearance       | Price Impact            | Popularity         |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0.98 Carat   | Slightly smaller | Lower cost than 1 carat | Less common choice |
| 1 Carat      | Full carat look  | Higher price            | Very popular       |

When shopping, consider that a 0.98 carat diamond can offer a similar appearance with potential savings.

You might find a higher quality diamond of the same budget if you choose less than a full carat.

Check carefully for factors like cut, clarity, and color, which can influence the beauty and price more than the small weight difference.

## Diamond Clarity And Its Influence In Price

**Diamond clarity** is a crucial factor in determining a diamond's price. Clarity grades measure the presence of internal flaws (inclusions) and external blemishes.

Higher clarity grades typically mean fewer imperfections, leading to a higher price.

Popular clarity grades such as **SI1 (Slightly Included 1)** are often chosen for their balance between appearance and cost.

While SI1 diamonds have some inclusions, they are usually not visible to the naked eye.

A higher clarity grade like **VVS1 (Very Very Slightly Included 1)** contains very few inclusions and commands a premium price.

In contrast, lower grades might have visible flaws, making them less expensive.

**Diamond color** and **cut** also affect a diamond's price, but they interact with clarity in determining the final value.

A well-cut diamond enhances clarity by reflecting light effectively, hiding minor inclusions.

**Fluorescence** can influence price as well. Some diamonds show a blue glow under UV light, which might lower their price if too strong, even if clarity is high.
